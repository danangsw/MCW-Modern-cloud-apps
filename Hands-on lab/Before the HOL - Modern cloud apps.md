# Modern cloud apps before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription

-   Local machine or Azure virtual machine configured with:

    -   Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or later

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

Before initiating the hands-on lab, you will setup an environment to use for the rest of the exercises.

### Task 1: Setup a development environment

1.  Create a virtual machine in Azure using the Visual Studio Community 2017 with the **latest release** on Windows Server 2016 image.
    - **Name**: Whatever you want
    - **User Name**: whatever you want
    - **Password**: Your choice, but make note of it
    - **Networking**: You may want to enable RDP (port 3389) for Remote Desktop access.

    ![The Azure Portal Search field text is Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64). In the Search results section, Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64) is selected.](images/Setup/image3.png "Azure Portal, Search results section")

>**Note**: It is **highly** recommended to use a DS2 or D2 instance size for this VM.

2. Install the Visual Studio Community 2017 features.
    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Community 2017 features installed.](images/Setup/image11.png "Installation details")

>**Note**: It is **highly** recommended to install minimum features:
    - ASP.NET and web development
    - Azure development
    - .NET Core cross-platform development

### Task 2: Disable IE Enhanced Security

>**Note**: Sometimes this image has IE ESC already disabled, and sometimes it does not.

1.  Connect and log on to the new VM you just created, click **Start** and then then **Server Manager** if not already started.

    ![Screenshot of the Server Manager icon.](images/Setup/image4.png "Server Manager icon")

2.  Select **Local Server**.

    ![Local Server is selected from the Server Manager menu.](images/Setup/image5.png "Server Manager menu")

3.  On the right side of the pane, click **On** by IE Enhanced Security Configuration.

    ![The On button is circled next to IE Enhanced Security Configuration.](images/Setup/image6.png "On button")

4.  Change to **Off** for Administrators, and select **OK**.

    ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, select Off for both Administrators and Users then click OK.](images/Setup/image7.png "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box")

### Task 3: Install SQL Server Management Studio

1.  On the new VM, download and install the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio from the URL below: [17.9.x as of Nov 2018]. This may take 15-20 minutes.

    <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx>

### Task 4: Validate connectivity to Azure

1.  Within your new virtual machine, launch Visual Studio, and validate you can login with your Microsoft Account when prompted.

2.  Validate connectivity to your Azure subscription. Launch Visual Studio, open Server Explorer from the View menu, and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription. Right click on Azure and select **Connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription**. Enter your credentials when prompted.

    ![A right-click menu displays over the Visual Studio Server Explorer window. Menu options include Refresh, connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription, Manage and Filter Subscriptions, and Open Getting Started Page, which indicate that you can connect to your Azure subscription.](images/Setup/image8.png "Visual Studio Server Explorer")

### Task 5: Download and explore the Contoso Sports League sample

1.  Create a new folder on your C: drive named **MCW**.

2.  Download the sample application from here: <https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Modern-cloud-apps/tree/master/Hands-on%20lab/Lab-files/Modern%20Cloud%20Apps%20Student%20Files.zip>  and extract to the newly created **MCW** folder.

3.  From the **Contoso Sports League** folder under **MCW**, open the Visual Studio Solution file: **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.sln**.

4.  The solution contains the following projects:

    |    |            |
    |----------|:-------------:|
    | Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web |   Contoso Sports League e-commerce application |
    | Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Admin |   Contoso Sports League call center admin application |
    | Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Data  |   Data tier |
    | Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Offers |  API for returning list of available products |
    | Contoso.Apps.PaymentGateway   |     API for payment processing |

### Task 6: Create a new Azure Resource Group

1.  Within the Azure Management Portal, open the **Resource groups** tile and then select **+Add**.

    ![In the Azure Management Portal, Resource groups is selected on the left, and the Add button selected on the right.](images/Setup/image9.png "Azure Management Portal")

2.  Specify the name of the resource group as **contososports**, and choose the Azure region into which you want to deploy the lab. This resource group will be used throughout the remainder of this Modern Cloud App lab. Click on **Create** to create the resource group.

    ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously described settings.](images/Setup/image10.png "Resource group blade")

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
