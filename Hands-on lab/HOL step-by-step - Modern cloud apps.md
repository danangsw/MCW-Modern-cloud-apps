# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. 

Please note that as opposed to the whiteboard design session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members working on the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Cloud Workshop: Modern Cloud Apps lab is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with additional team members to more closely model a real-world experience, and to allow members to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

## Exercise 1: Proof of concept deployment

Duration: 60 minutes

Contoso has asked you to create a proof of concept deployment in Microsoft Azure by deploying the web, database, and API applications for the solution as well as validating that the core functionality of the solution works. Ensure all resources use the same resource group previously created for the App Service Environment.

### Task 1: Deploy the e-commerce website, SQL Database, and storage

In this exercise, you will provision a website via the Azure **Web App + SQL** template using the Microsoft Azure Portal. You will then edit the necessary configuration files in the starter project and deploy the e-commerce website.

#### Subtask 1: Create the Web App and SQL database instance

1.  Navigate to the Azure Management portal, [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/), using a new tab or instance and login with your lab-provided Azure credentials.

2.  In the navigation menu to the left, select **+Create a resource** and in the Marketplace search text box, enter **Web App + SQL** and select the appropriate auto-suggestion.

    ![In the Azure Portal on the left, "+Create a resource", search box text and auto-suggestion are surrounded by red boxes.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image11.png "Azure Portal")

3.  In the new product blade, select **Create**.

    ![The Web App + SQL blade](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image13.png "Web App + SQL blade")


4.  On the Web App blade, specify the following configuration:

    -  A unique and valid name (until the green check mark appears). We've used ContosoAp2010. Make note of your selection.

    -  Select **contososports** resource group.

    -  **ContosoSportsPlan** as a new App Service Plan. Make sure it's in the same location as the **contososports** resource group you created earlier. Use the default **Standard S1** pricing tier. 

5. Select **SQL Database *Configure required settings***, and then **+ Create a new database**.

    ![The tile for the Create a new database option is displayed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image16.png " Create a new database")

6. On the **SQL Database** blade, specify **ContosSportsDB** as the database name and then select **Target** **Server *Configure required settings***.

    ![Screenshot of the Target Server Configure required settings option.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image18.png "Target Server Configure required settings option")

7. On the **New server** blade, specify the following configuration:

    -  Server name: **A unique value (ensure the green checkmark appears)**

    -  Server admin login: **demouser**

    -  Password and Confirm Password: **Password.1!!**

    -  Ensure the **Location** is the same region as the Web app.

    ![Fields in the New server blade are circled and set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image19.png "New server blade")

8. Once the values are accepted in the **New server** blade, click **Select**.

    ![Screenshot of the Select button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image20.png "Select button")

## Exercise 3: Automating backend processes with Azure Functions and Logic Apps

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating receipts in PDF format and alerting users when their orders have been processed using Azure Logic App and Functions. To run custom snippets of C\# or node.js in logic apps, you can create custom functions through Azure Functions. [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) offers server-free computing in Microsoft Azure and are useful for performing these tasks:

-   Advanced formatting or compute of fields in logic apps

-   Perform calculations in a workflow

-   Extend the logic app functionality with functions that are supported in C\# or node.js

### Task 1: Create an Azure Function to Generate PDF Receipts

1.  Click the **+Create a resource** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal and then click **Compute \> Function App**. Then in the new blade, select your Subscription, type an unique App name that identifies your function app, then specify the following settings:

    -   [**Resource Group**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview): Use the existing resource group, **contososports**.

    -   [**Hosting plan**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview): One of the following plans:

        -   **Hosting plan**: The default hosting plan type for Azure Functions is **Consumption Plan**. When you choose a consumption plan, you must also choose the **Location**. For now, select **App Service Plan**.

        -   **App Service plan**: An App Service plan requires you to create an **App Service plan/location** or select an existing one. These settings determine the [location, features, cost, and compute resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) associated with your app. For now, select the existing App Service Plan you have been using so far in this lab. 

        -   **Storage account**: Each function app requires a storage account. Choose the existing storage account by clicking **Select Existing** and choosing the storage account in the **contososports** resource group.

    ![On the left side of the Portal, the Create a resource button is selected. In the middle, under New, Compute is selected. On the right, under Compute, Function App is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image221.png "Azure Portal")

    ![Under Azure Functions, on the Actions tab, a single Action, the Azure function contosofunction2101, is listed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image247.png "Azure Functions")

13. Type this in the Request Body:

    ```json
    {"Order": pick MessageText from list on right }
    ```

    Make sure the syntax is json format. Sometimes the ":" will go to the right side of MessageText by mistake. Keep it on the left. It should look like this:

    ![Under ContosoMakePDF, the previous JSON code is typed in the Request Body, and to the right of this, in Insert parameters from previous steps, Message text is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image248.png "ContosoMakePDF")

14. Click **Save** to save the Logic App.

15. There is one modification we need to make in the code. Click on the **CodeView** button.

    ![In the Logic App, the CodeView button is selected from the top menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image250.png "Logic App")

16. Find the line of code in the body for the Order item that reads the MessageText value from the queue, and add the base64 function around it to ensure it encoded before passing it off to the Azure function. It should look like the following:

    ```json
    "Order": "@{base64(triggerBody()?['MessageText'])}"
    ```

    ![In the Order item code, the following line of code is circled: \"Order\": \"@{base64(triggerBody()?\[\'MessageText\'\])}\"](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image251.png "Order item code")

    Click **Save** again.

17. Run the logic app. It should process the orders you have submitted previously to test PDF generation. Using Azure Storage Explorer or Visual Studio Cloud Explorer you can navigate to the storage account and open the receipts container to see the created PDFs.

    ![In Azure Storage Explorer, on the left, the following tree view is expanded: Storage Accounts\\contososportsstorage01r\\Blob Containers. Under Blob Containers, receipts is selected.

23. From the drop-down select the name of the table, **Orders**.

    ![In the Update row section, under Table name, Orders is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image258.png "Update row section")

24. Press **Save** and ignore the error. Click the **Code View** button.

25. Replace these lines:

    ![Screenshot of code to be replaced.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image259.png "Code view")

    With these:

    ```json
    "OrderDate": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['OrderDate']}",
    "FirstName": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['FirstName']}",
    "LastName": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['LastName']}",
    "Address": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Address']}",
    "City": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['City']}",
    "State": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['State']}",
    "PostalCode": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['PostalCode']}",
    "Country": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Country']}",
    "Phone": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Phone']}",
    "SMSOptIn": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['SMSOptIn']}",
    "SMSStatus": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['SMSStatus']}",
    "Email": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['Email']}",

    "PaymentTransactionId": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['PaymentTransactionId']}",
    "HasBeenShipped": "@{body('ContosoMakePDF')['HasBeenShipped']}"
    ```

26. And modify the path variable to include the index key or OrderId to be as follows:

    ```json
    "path": "/datasets/default/tables/@{encodeURIComponent(encodeURIComponent('[dbo].[Orders]'))}/items/@{encodeURIComponent(encodeURIComponent(body('ContosoMakePDF')['OrderId']))}"
    ```

    The code should now look as follows for the update\_row method:

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1.  Since the HOL is now complete, go ahead and delete all of the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
